# Ask me anything!

Over the nearly 25 years of my career, I've navigated the dynamic landscapes of digital agencies and startups alike. My journey has seen me wearing various hats - from a developer to a software architect, scrum master to product owner, UX lead to team lead, and from a CTO to a company owner. My experience spans both sides of the table; I've served clients with dedication and, at times, stood in their shoes, understanding their needs firsthand. My work has touched both the personalized environments of small businesses and the complex structures of large corporations.
